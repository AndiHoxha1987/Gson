# Gson

This project is focused on Gson and SharedPreferences. 
Converting Gson object into strings and reverse, it's a good trick how to save data into SharedPreferences.
This approach can be used to save arraylist into sharedPreferences too, because sharedPrefferences don't read arraylist but they can 
read strings so we can use Gson to convert ArrayList into a string and later we can call it to convert that string into ArrayList
